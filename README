 LIBRARIES
 ======
 Sugar has no dependency mechanism yet. So we have to ship 3rd party libraries
 with this project. We do not want to version these libs in our VCS, so you will have
 to download them and put them into the projects `geospace/lib' folder on your own.
   These are the libs used the project depends on:

  1) Shapely-1.0.14-py2.5
  2) geojson
  3) mozrunner-2.3.2-py2.5
  4) simplejson-2.0.9-py2.5-linux-i686 (if python <= 2.5)
